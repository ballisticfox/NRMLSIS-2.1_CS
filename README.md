# NRMLSIS-2.1_CS
Transferring NRMLSIS to C# and refactoring it for use in games like KSP and KSA.

Translated by ballisticfox.

Based on the original Fortran 90 Code hosted here: https://map.nrl.navy.mil/map/pub/nrl/NRLMSIS/NRLMSIS2.1/

Branches:

- main - stable state of the project, may not be a 1:1 code mapping from F90 to C#, but retains the same outputs, currently reflects refactor_v1.
- archive - an archive of the 1:1 F90 to C# mapping created at the beginning of the project.
- refactor_v1 - readability improvements, broke massive files into smaller sections, API implementation.
  
Active branches:
- refactor_v2
